<h1>Welcome to PR Podcast</h1>

<p>
In each PR Podcast, <a href="https://arashTaher.wordpress.com">Arash</a> and Mehdi talk to one of the creators and contributors of an open-source project.
</p>

<p>
Our focus is mostly on:
<ul>
    <li>Incentives to start an open-source project</li>
    <li>Experience of working on such project</li>
    <li>Technical challenges</li>
    <li>Interactions with the community</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<strong>You are welcome to reach out to use in case you have an open-source project</strong> or if you know someone who you might find a good candidate for this podcast.
Our email address is PRPodcast2020 at Gmail dot com.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note</strong>: For now, all the episodes are in Farsi, something we hope that can change in the future. We are open to requests for having interview with developers in English.
</p>

<h4>Check out the source code</h4>
More than anything, this podcast is a place for us to improve ourselves as developers. So, as an interesting challenge, I decided to write the whole website without using any frameworks or libraries.
<p>The code for the template engine, testing framework and the build system can be found in <a href="https://github.com/arashThr/prpodcast-website/">PR Podcast website repo</a>

<h4>Why is the look of the site so primitive?</h4>
The design of the website is influenced by <a href="https://brutalist-web.design/">Brutalist Web Design principles</a>.
As a software developer, mostly working on back-end stuff, I'm not superb at aesthetics and web designs. Instead, I focused on usability and accessibility.
<p>But, we are open to pull requests. So, <strong>if you are a web designer</strong>, and you think you can help with the way the website look, feel free to open a PR.</p>
